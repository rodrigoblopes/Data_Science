# Rodrigo Lopes
<sub>*Data Scientist apprentice*</sub>

With over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I've learned a lot and am still eager to learn more and improve my skills. My background in Data centers, Cloud Computing, Web Hosting, and Hybrid cloud environments is a result of a lot of hard work and dedication, but I still have a lot to learn and I enjoy the journey of discovery. I have a proven track record of delivering results through TCO, ROI, and Business Case analysis with a customer-centric approach, that's what makes me a real ninja. Recently, I've been diving into the depths of the dive industry as a training manager for the past 3 years, but now I'm ready to surface and transition into Data Science, leveraging my technical skills and expertise to extract insights from big data like a true treasure hunter. Let's dive into the world of data together!

As an aprentice Data Scientist and Master Scuba Diver Trainer I combine analytical skills, ability to work in team environments, and attention to details. Having spend the last years applying Machine Learning to Dive Industry real problems, I developed a critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

My credentials include a Graduate in Information Technology Project Management from the Sao Paulo University (USP), an institution of higher education and advanced research rated as one of the top 3 and most prestigious universities in Brazil.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.
